🌍 Language Detection using Naive Bayes

This project is a Language Detection App built with Naive Bayes Classifier and Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer).
The app is deployed using Streamlit and can detect the language of any given text in multiple languages such as English, Hindi, Tamil, French, German, Russian, and more (depending on your dataset).

📌 Features
    ✅ Detects the language of a given text input
    ✅ Uses CountVectorizer (Bag of Words) for feature extraction
    ✅ Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification
    ✅ Interactive Streamlit Web App interface
    ✅ Displays the detected language instantly
