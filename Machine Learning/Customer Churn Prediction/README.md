# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction App

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a **Customer Churn Prediction System** designed to identify customers who are likely to leave a service (such as telecom). The solution uses **multiple machine learning algorithms** to train and evaluate models and is deployed using a **Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions.

### Models Evaluated:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- AdaBoost  
- Gradient Boosting  

After evaluation, **XGBoost** was selected for deployment due to its **highest accuracy** on the dataset.
