This project demonstrates the application of regularization techniques in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
I have implemented and compared the performance of the following regression models:

1. Linear Regression (No regularization)
2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
3. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

All models were trained and evaluated using an alpha value of 0.01 (regularization strength). 
The goal was to observe how regularization impacts the model coefficients and performance.
