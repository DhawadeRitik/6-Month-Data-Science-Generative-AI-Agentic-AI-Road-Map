🏠 House Price Prediction using Regression Models

This machine learning project focuses on predicting house prices using various regression algorithms. The aim is to compare the performance of multiple regression models using key evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score.

📌 Project Overview

In this project, we use a dataset containing information about houses (e.g., number of rooms, location, area, etc.) to predict the price of a house. We apply multiple regression techniques and evaluate their performance to determine the most effective model for this task.

✅ Objectives

- Apply different regression models to predict house prices.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of each model using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R² Score
- Identify the best-performing model for house price prediction.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
- R² Score : Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
